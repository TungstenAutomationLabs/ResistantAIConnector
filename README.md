# ResistantAIConnector

Resistant AI (RAI) helps customers identify suspicious cases of client onboarding by uncovering where documents submitted as part of a loan application, claim or KYC process have been digitally modified. The technology is language agnostic, helping us detect forgeries on documents from all over the world. Resistant AI can also link seemingly random fraudulent documents through visual similarities and submission characteristics to uncover clusters of fraud where the same document templates have been used for multiple applications, indicative of organized financial crime activity.

The TotalAgility Connector for Resistant AI is a packaged solution available on Tungsten Marketplace that partners and customers can leverage to introduce fraud check capabilities into their workflow.
